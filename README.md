# **LSTM Price Prediction**

## **Introduction**

This is my initial implementation of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for price prediction. I am releasing this code for public use to help others utilize and build upon it. Additionally, I have used other models for similar projects, and their source code is available on my GitHub repository.

The model predicts the *Open*, *High*, *Low*, and *Close* prices for various financial assets, including indices, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and currency pairs. The following sections present the performance metrics of the model.
